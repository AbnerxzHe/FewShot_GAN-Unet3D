# Few-shot 3D Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Learning
This repository contain the tensorflow implementation of the model we proposed in our paper of the same name: Few-shot 3D Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Learning, submitted in Medical Image Analysis, October 2018.

## Some results from our paper

* Visual comparison of the segmentation by each model, for two test subjects of the iSEG-2017 dataset, when training with different numbers of labeled examples.

* Segmentation of Subject 10 of the iSEG-2017 dataset predicted by different GAN-based models, when trained with 2 labeled images. The red box highlights a region in the ground truth where all these models give noticeable differences.
