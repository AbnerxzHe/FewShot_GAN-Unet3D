# Few-shot 3D Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Learning
This repository contain the tensorflow implementation of the model we proposed in our paper of the same name: Few-shot 3D Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Learning, submitted in Medical Image Analysis, October 2018.

## Some results from our paper

* Different views of a smoothed version of contours provided by our automatic segmentation system. In these images, the thalamus, caudate, putamen and pallidum are respectively depicted in yellow, cyan, red and green.

* Feature map activations in all convolutional layers of the FCNN (right), obtained for a given patch of the input MRI image (left). Each column corresponds to a different convolutional layer, from shallow to deeper, and each image in a row to a features map activation randomly selected in the layer.
